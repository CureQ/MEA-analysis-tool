# MEA-analysis-tool
A Graphical User Interface (GUI) that interacts with the [CureQ-MEA library] (https://github.com/CureQ/CureQ)

## Installation and usage
There are several ways how the CureQ MEA-analysis tool can be acquired:
1.
By downloading all files located in the 'Source' folder, and executing the file: “CureQ_MEA-analysis_tool.py”
